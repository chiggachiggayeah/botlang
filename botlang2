I was wondering if blogs might be affected by the recent chatbot phenomenon. conversational
UI's aren't anything new but they're experiencing a resurgence as we collectively
come to grips with the thought that traditional gui's might not be the best interface
for everything. Because of this I also started thinking about blogs. Blogs are everywhere
despite increasing irrelevance as people concentrate their internet personas into a handful of
silos. I see advice constantly, urging people to start their own blogs for myriad reasons, and yet,
I'm still confused as to what exactly the point of a blog is, especially as it becomes ever more
difficult to find the good ones. It seems like most people would rather read an aggregated stream
of content from multiple people that they're interested in. Of course, the main problem then is that
it's platform x reaping the main benefits of a person's content. If blogs were bots, perhaps people
could maintain control over their content, while still maintaining many of the benefits of serving content
on one of the larger platforms out in the world. A bot can be available over SMS, through a web page, and in
app format. Maybe they could succeed where RSS came up short.

Did you wanna hear what's been on Jordan's mind lately?

[[n,no,nah,naw]] -> `Cool, cool. Some other time.`

<<<
[[y,yes,yeah,yea]] -> `Been thinking a lot about No Man's Sky lately. I'm
so excited to play it, both because it looks amazing and because the procedural generation
going on is mind boggling from an engineering perspective. I really want to look into making a game
where procedural generation is a main component. Maybe in a side project or two.`

Jordan's other projects you can ask about: ruckus, whit

[[ruckus]] -> `Ruckus is a realtime game I built with socket.io and node. It was a project
I built over the summer to play around with node and web sockets. Not much functionality currently,
but hopefully I'll add more soon.`

<<<
[[whit]] -> `I had an idea, after hearing about Feross Aboukhadijeh's WebTorrent and being a
long time fan of Medium. Basically the premise was, what if one could build a decentralized newspaper, where
content was hosted by whoever wrote it? This was also a fun opportunity to learn some React. I still want to
return to this project soon because I think the kernel of the idea is pretty neat.`
